Supply API

The Supply API provides functionality to support the ownership transfer requirements typical of a supply chain process. Items in the supply chain can be given a value and this value can be updated over time. The supply API supports the readonly, raw, basic and JSON formats and the user is required to specify the format.

The readonly and raw formats are useful when developers wish to store arbitrary data, without incurring the overhead of defining an object. The value will be provided with the data parameter. The readonly format cannot be updated and is stored in a readonly register. The raw format is stored in a raw register and allows the data to be updated.

The basic format allows callers to define an asset in terms of simple key=value pairs. It assumes all values are stored using the string data type. The key=value pairs can be updated. . The JSON format allows callers to provide a detailed definition of the supply data structure, with each field defined with a specific data type and mutability. Items defined with one of the complex formats can be updated after their initial creation.

The supply API also provides a history of changes to the values, as well as the history of ownership of the item.

The full supported endpoint of the supply URI is as follows:

supply/verb/noun/filter/operator

The minimum required components of the URI are:

supply/verb/noun

[raw] - An object register containing raw object.
[readonly] - An object register containing read-only object.
[any] - An object selection noun allowing mixed items.
create

Create a new object register specified by given noun.

supply/create/noun

This command only supports the item, raw readonly and any nouns.
create/item

Creates a new item on a object register.
create/raw

Creates a new item on a raw register.
create/readonly

Creates a new item on a readonly register.
create/any

Creates a new item specified by the format parameter.
Parameters:

pin : Required if locked. The PIN for this profile.

session : Required by argument -multiuser=1 to be supplied to identify the user session. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

name : Optional name to identify the asset. If provided a Name object will also be created in the users local namespace, allowing the asset to be accessed/retrieved by name. If no name is provided the asset will need to be accessed/retrieved by its 256-bit register address.

format : Required to identify the format used to define the asset. Values can be readonly, raw, basic and JSON.

data : Required if format is readonly or raw, then this field contains the hex-encoded data to be stored in this asset. readonly assets cannot be updated read-only. All other preceding fields are ignored.

<fieldname>=<value> : If format is basic, then the caller can provide additional = pairs for each piece of data to store in the asset. json : If format is JSON, then this field will hold the json definition of the asset as a JSON array of objects representing each field in the object. It uses the following format:

    name : The name of the data field.

    type : The data type to use for this field. Values can be uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uint256, uint512, uint1024, string, or bytes.

    value : The default value of the field.

    mutable : The boolean field to indicate whether the field is writable (true) or read-only (false).

    maxlength: Only applicable to string or bytes fields where mutable=true, this is the maximum number of characters (bytes) that can be stored in the field. If no maxlength parameter is provided then we will default the field size to the length of the default value rounded up to the nearest 64 bytes.

NOTE:

    There is a limit of 1KB for item data to be saved in the register, excluding the item name.
    There is a fee of 1 NXS for creating and an item and an additional 1 NXS for the optional name object.
